"""Close the seven receipt rules the conformance set never exercised.

Each of these checks exists in the verifier with no vector behind it, so an
implementation could omit the check entirely and still pass. One fixture per rule,
each triggering exactly that rule and nothing else.

The existing fixtures pin a key whose private half is not published, so these pin
their own deterministic test key. Public JWKs only.
