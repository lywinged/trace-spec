"""Run the adequacy criteria over every vector set in the repository, ours included.

The criteria come from defects found on real sets. A standard that only ever measures
other people's work is advocacy, so this module measures every set by the same loader
and records the shortfalls where they fall rather than where it would be comfortable.

Where they fall today: `canonicalization-boundary`, which is ours, expects acceptance
in every vector, so it cannot tell a conformant verifier from one that accepts
unconditionally. That is recorded in `KNOWN_ONE_DIRECTIONAL` with the record asserted
exactly, so it cannot widen unnoticed and the entry is deleted when the missing
direction is added. `build-provenance-depth` carries a margin at every boundary and
nothing is recorded against it.

A set is measured here or named in `MEASURED_ELSEWHERE` with the test that covers it.
Neither is possible to skip: `test_every_vector_set_on_disk_is_measured_somewhere`
compares both against what is actually in `examples/`, because a hand-maintained list
of what gets graded is the same defect these criteria exist to catch, in the one place
it would otherwise be invisible.
