"""Run the adequacy criteria over every vector set in the repository, ours included.

The criteria come from defects found on real sets. A standard that only ever measures
other people's work is advocacy, so this module measures every set by the same loader
and records the shortfalls where they fall rather than where it would be comfortable.

`canonicalization-boundary` previously expected acceptance in every vector, so it
could not tell a conformant verifier from one that accepts unconditionally. Its
non-JCS signing-preimage negatives supply the missing direction. No set currently
needs an exemption in `KNOWN_ONE_DIRECTIONAL`; any future shortfall is recorded
exactly rather than allowed to widen unnoticed.

A set is measured here or named in `MEASURED_ELSEWHERE` with the test that covers it.
Neither is possible to skip: `test_every_vector_set_on_disk_is_measured_somewhere`
compares both against what is actually in `examples/`, because a hand-maintained list
of what gets graded is the same defect these criteria exist to catch, in the one place
it would otherwise be invisible.
