"""Conformance checks for the informative action-receipt fixture set.

The verifier consumes an explicit registry of named rules (``RULES``) rather than
emitting failure codes inline. The registry is the inventory: every obligation this
verifier enforces is one ``Rule`` entry, and the completeness suite in
`test_vector_completeness.py` mutates registry entries by name — removing or weakening
one hook at a time — to prove each rule is load-bearing for at least two independent
fixtures.

That shape is deliberate, and it is the review outcome of upstream #124: an earlier
revision recovered the rule inventory from this module's source by AST-walking for
string literals appended to failure lists. The review's objection stands — ``append``
vs ``extend``, constants, f-strings and refactors all create silent blind spots in a
source-derived inventory. A registry the verifier itself consumes turns "add a rule
without adding it to the inventory" from heuristically detectable into structurally
difficult: a check that is not registered is a check that never runs, and an
unregistered emission path is a guard failure, not a silent hole.
