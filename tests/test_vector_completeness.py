"""Completeness checks over the conformance vector sets.

The other modules ask whether the vectors are *correct*. This one asks whether they are
*complete*: does every obligation the verifier implements have vectors that notice when
the obligation is gone — and notice it from more than one direction?

The rule inventory is ``RULES``, the registry the verifier itself consumes. An earlier
revision recovered the inventory from the verifier's source with ``ast``, and upstream
#124's review identified the failure mode this creates: a rule written as
``failures.extend([...])``, ``+=``, an f-string or a named constant is invisible to the
walk, and the suite reports complete coverage over an inventory that is quietly missing
entries. The registry inverts that. A check that is not registered never runs, so it
cannot silently exist outside the inventory; and ``test_no_emission_outside_the_registry``
is the residual guard for code that would try to emit around the registry.

Mutation therefore targets **named rule hooks**: a rule is deleted by rebuilding the
registry without its entry, or weakened by substituting its check — never by pattern-
matching source text. Same review, same reason: mutate what the verifier actually
consumes, so the mutation cannot drift away from the code under test.

The questions, in increasing strength:

1. Does any fixture expect a code the registry cannot produce? (dead expectations)
2. Is every registered rule exercised by some fixture? (unexercised rules)
3. Does deleting each rule change at least **two** fixtures' outcomes? (#124: single-
   vector coverage has no margin — one fixture weakened or renamed away silently
   removes a rule's coverage)
4. Are two of those fixtures **independent** — is there a single plausible
   implementation defect that one catches and the other misses? Two copies of the same
   vector satisfy question 3 and fail this one.
5. Has any rule's margin dropped below what it was? (silent thinning)

Independence is #124's definition made executable. For every rule, ``DEFECTS`` declares
at least one *weakened* variant of its check, each modelling a real implementation
shortcut: comparing digest prefixes, case-insensitive identifier matching, structural
signature validation without cryptography, clock-skew tolerances. A rule's vectors are
independent when some declared defect deviates at least one of them from its expected
outcome while leaving another undisturbed. The declaration is fail-closed: a registered
rule with no defect entry fails the suite, so the question "what bug would your second
vector catch that your first would not?" has to be answered when the rule is added,
not after a regression demonstrates it.
