"""Canonicalization boundary vectors (spec section 3.2.2).

The spec requires an RFC 8785-conformant library and names
``json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`` as insufficient. On every other record in this
repository the two agree byte-for-byte, so nothing distinguished an implementation
that complied from one that did not. These vectors are the records on which they
disagree: schema-valid, correctly signed, and rejected by any verifier whose
canonicalizer is one of the ad-hoc forms below.

Each fixture declares ``diverges_under``. The declaration is recomputed here, not
trusted: a vector that stopped diverging would otherwise keep documenting a
distinction it no longer makes.
