"""The runtime-evidence corpus, measured as far as this repository honestly can.

`docs/rfcs/runtime-evidence-profile.md` proposes that a record carry its attestation
evidence, and its own §8 says TRACE must not become an attestation verifier: `format`
selects someone else's. That commitment decides what this file can assert.

**In scope here**, and asserted unconditionally on every vector: the committed records
are schema-valid against the draft schema, their signatures verify over the RFC 8785
canonical form, the evidence member is shaped as the profile describes, and each vector
carries the expectation the corpus grades it against.

**Out of scope here**, deliberately: whether a quote verifies. That needs a TDX
verifier, this project does not ship one, and the proposal argues it should not start.
`examples/runtime-evidence/generate.py` performs that half against `agent-manifest`'s
verifier and reports 13/13, and `examples/runtime-evidence/test_appraisal.py` runs it in
the dedicated `runtime-evidence` CI job against a pinned verifier commit.

The split is stated rather than hidden because a test that quietly skipped the
hardware half would look like coverage and be none, which is the defect the profile is
about. What is measured here is measured on every run; what is not is named.
