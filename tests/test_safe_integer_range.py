"""The JCS safe-integer range, spec section 3.2.2 (issue: number serialization).

Section 3.2.2 serializes numbers as IEEE 754 doubles, so `9007199254740992` and
`9007199254740993` reach one canonical form and one signature stands for two
objects. RFC 8785 Appendix B note 1 names the range this repository now holds
every signed object to, and section 3.2.2 raises that note's SHOULD to a MUST.

These tests grew out of `test_canonicalization_boundary.py`, whose subject is the
four vectors that separate a conformant canonicalizer from `json.dumps`. The
number surface cannot be carried by a vector at all, because a positive vector is
a schema-valid record and these are exactly the records the schema now rejects,
so it is carried here instead: structurally, behaviourally, and by pinning the
prose that states the rule to the fact it states.

`examples/canonicalization-boundary/number_divergence_repro.py` reproduces the
whole argument on the standard library alone, and one of the tests below runs it.
