"""Every public function in the package, swept, against the error its module documents.

This test exists because the claim it makes was made once before without it. The change
that closed the last three record-argument leaks said "every public entry point in the
package now reports zero leaks under the same sweep", and the sweep was never committed.
Nobody could re-run it, including its author, and it was wrong in a way that is invisible
from the sentence: it fed record-shaped values, so it never reached the functions whose
argument is a key, and ``key_to_jwk`` leaked ``AttributeError`` on every input including
the public key that is the plausible mistake for a function with that name.

A claim about a surface has to be checked by something that finds the surface. So the
functions here are discovered by walking the package, and ``DOCUMENTED`` has to name every
module they live in or the first test fails. Adding a module without deciding what it
refuses with is the failure this catches; adding one and quietly not sweeping it is the
failure that produced this file.

What it does not do: sweep every argument of every function. It sweeps the first
positional argument, holding the rest valid, which is where externally-supplied data
arrives. ``CALLS`` is written out per function rather than generated, because a generated
call passes ``None`` for the arguments it does not vary, and a ``TypeError`` from the
second argument then reads exactly like a leak in the first. That happened while this file
was being written, and produced a finding against ``verify_bridge`` that did not exist.
