"""Every public function in the package, swept, against the error its module documents.

This test exists because the claim it makes was made once before without it. The change
that closed the last three record-argument leaks said "every public entry point in the
package now reports zero leaks under the same sweep", and the sweep was never committed.
Nobody could re-run it, including its author, and it was wrong in a way that is invisible
from the sentence: it fed record-shaped values, so it never reached the functions whose
argument is a key, and ``key_to_jwk`` leaked ``AttributeError`` on every input including
the public key that is the plausible mistake for a function with that name.

A claim about a surface has to be checked by something that finds the surface. So the
functions here are discovered by walking the package, and ``DOCUMENTED`` has to name every
module they live in or the first test fails. Adding a module without deciding what it
refuses with is the failure this catches; adding one and quietly not sweeping it is the
failure that produced this file.

``CALLS`` sweeps the first positional argument, holding the rest valid, which is where
externally-supplied data arrives. It is written out per function rather than generated,
because a generated call passes ``None`` for the arguments it does not vary, and a
``TypeError`` from the second argument then reads exactly like a leak in the first. That
happened while this file was being written, and produced a finding against
``verify_bridge`` that did not exist.

``KEYWORD_CALLS`` sweeps every other parameter, one at a time, from a call that is valid
in full. It exists because the first version of this file said "what it does not do:
sweep every argument", listed ``build_record`` and ``verify_bridge`` as having no
positional argument to sweep, and #320 then arrived on ``build_record``'s ``issued_at``,
a keyword argument that ``int()`` coerced before the guard saw it. An exemption with a
true reason is still an exemption: "no positional argument" was correct and the leaks
were on the other kind. Every parameter of every public function is now either swept
here or named in ``UNSWEPT_PARAMETERS`` with the reason, and the coverage test holds the
three sets equal to the signatures, so a new parameter fails until somebody decides.

The assertions decide what must be refused. What each parameter *accepts* is a judgment,
so ``tools/sweep_public_surface.py`` prints it from these same tables as a report for a
reader; the last two tests hold that the report still runs over every function here and
that its ``--strict`` exit goes red the moment a leak is not filed.
