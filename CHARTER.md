# Technical Charter: TRACE

**Hosting**: The Linux Foundation, as its own series: "TRACE Specification, a Series of LF Projects, LLC". The Linux Foundation [announced the contribution](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-welcomes-trace-to-advance-verifiable-runtime-evidence-for-ai-workloads) on 25 August 2026. The technical home for ongoing specification work is not yet settled. This supersedes the earlier proposal to split the specification, IP, and trademark to the Linux Foundation entity hosting the Model Context Protocol.  
**Status**: Draft. The Linux Foundation has accepted the contribution; the Technical Charter and Project Contribution Agreement are still being executed with LF Projects, LLC. This charter is effective when the Technical Charter takes effect.

> **Note for external contributors:** The Linux Foundation has accepted TRACE, but this charter is still a working draft and the Technical Charter has not yet taken effect. Governance terms, IP policy, and conformance mark ownership described here are proposed, not final. Do not implement production systems based on governance commitments in this document until v1.0 ratification.  
**Version**: 0.1 (aligned with spec v0.1)

## 1. Mission

The TRACE project develops and maintains an open, portable, hardware-attested governance record for AI agents and other confidential workloads. The mission is to make execution governance evidence verifiable by any party: without trusting the operator, without callbacks to the issuer, and without vendor lock-in to any cloud, silicon vendor, or AI provider.

## 2. Scope

The project includes:

- **The TRACE Specification**: normative text defining the Trust Record schema, wire format, signing and key management protocol, verification rules, hardware root profiles, and conformance requirements.
- **JSON Schema**: machine-readable schema for Trust Record validation.
- **Conformance test suite**: the canonical tests validating compliance (in [agentrust-io/trace-tests](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-tests)).
- **Vendor platform annexes**: informative, vendor-co-authored claim-mapping documents for each silicon and cloud attestation surface.
- **Reference examples**: example Trust Records for each supported hardware platform.

Out of scope: runtime policy enforcement engines, TEE platform SDKs, AI model governance beyond execution evidence, and hardware side-channel mitigations.

## 3. Technical Steering Committee

Upon host organization acceptance, governance transitions from the current Project Lead model to a Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

**Composition**: 3 to 9 members. No single organization may hold more than 40% of TSC seats. The founding Project Lead (Imran Siddique) holds one founding seat for the v1.0 ratification cycle.

**Election**: TSC members are elected annually by active contributors (at least one merged PR or accepted spec change in the preceding 12 months). Each contributor has one vote.

**Quorum**: Two-thirds of TSC members must participate for a vote to be valid.

**Decisions**:
- Spec errata and editorial changes: simple TSC majority
- Non-breaking spec versions (new optional fields, new platform profiles): two-thirds TSC majority + 14-day public comment
- Breaking spec versions (mandatory field changes, algorithm deprecations, wire format changes): two-thirds TSC majority + 30-day public comment + explicit backward-compatibility statement

**Meetings**: Monthly public TSC meeting. Notes published within 5 business days.

## 4. Intellectual Property Policy

All contributions must be made under the terms of [LICENSE](LICENSE). Contributors must sign commits with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). No contribution may incorporate material covered by a patent the contributor is unwilling to license royalty-free to conforming implementations.

Normative specification text and the normative TRACE JSON Schema are licensed under the Community Specification License 1.0. Source code, examples, workflows, and tests are licensed under Apache License 2.0. Documentation other than specification materials is licensed under CC BY 4.0. Earlier specification publications remain available under the licenses stated when they were published. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and the [license map](Governance/License.md).

## 5. Trademark Policy

"TRACE" as a specification name and the "TRACE-conformant" conformance mark are currently held by OPAQUE Systems, Inc. Upon host organization acceptance, trademark ownership transfers to the host under their standard trademark policy.

Use of "TRACE-conformant" to describe an implementation is permitted only when that implementation passes the published conformance test suite for the version being claimed.

## 6. Conformance

An implementation may claim TRACE conformance only by passing the conformance test suite in [agentrust-io/trace-tests](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-tests) at the level being claimed (Level 0, 1, or 2). Conformance claims must reference the test suite version and include a link to a passing run.

Test suite changes that would invalidate previously conformant implementations require a spec version increment.

## 7. Relationship to other standards

TRACE profiles, and does not replace:

- **RATS / EAT (RFC 9711)**: wire envelope
- **SLSA**: build provenance
- **SPIFFE / SPIRE**: workload identity
- **SCITT**: transparency anchoring
- **EAR (draft-ietf-rats-ar4si)**: verifier appraisal
- **MCP / A2A**: agent execution surface
- **AIBOM (SPDX 3.0, CycloneDX 1.7)**: model component inventory

TRACE participates in IETF RATS, SCITT, and EAR working groups as a consuming profile, not a competing standard.

## 8. Transition timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|---|---|
| v0.1 draft: CC Summit announcement | June 2026 |
| LF Projects series formation | Q3 2026 |
| MCP profile and A2A profile (v0.2) | Q3 2026 |
| Host organization submission | Q3 2026 |
| v1.0 ratification under TSC governance | 2027 |

## 9. Amendments

Amendments to this charter require a two-thirds TSC majority and a 30-day public comment period. Before host organization acceptance, amendments require Project Lead approval and 14-day notice to contributors.

## 10. Sponsors

Organizations providing financial, engineering, infrastructure, or other material support are recognized in [SPONSORS.md](SPONSORS.md). Sponsorship is separate from project governance and does not confer specification authority, additional voting rights, preferential conformance treatment, or endorsement of a sponsor's implementation.
