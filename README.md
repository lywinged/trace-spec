An open specification for hardware-attested AI agent governance records. TRACE defines the format, anchoring protocol, and verification rules for cryptographically provable evidence that an AI agent ran under a specific policy, in a verified hardware environment, on classified data, invoking identified tools, all bound into a single signed artifact rooted in silicon attestation.

A TRACE Trust Record answers: _what ran, where, under which policy, touching which data, calling which tools_, in a form any third party can verify without trusting the operator.

## What a Trust Record proves

Each question maps to a claim a third party can check for themselves.

| Question | TRACE claim |
|---|---|
| What model ran? | `model.model_id` + `model.weights_digest` |
| Where did it run? | `runtime.platform` + `runtime.measurement` |
| Under which policy? | `policy.bundle_hash` + `policy.enforcement_mode` |
| What data did it touch? | `data_class` |
| Which tools were called? | `tool_transcript.hash` + `tool_transcript.call_count` |
| Is the record independently anchored? | `transparency` (SCITT receipt URI) |

## Quick start

```bash
pip install agentrust-trace
```

```python
import time
from agentrust_trace import generate_key, sign_record

key = generate_key()

record = {
    "eat_profile": "tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2",
    "iat": int(time.time()),
    "subject": "spiffe://trust.example.org/agent/payments-processor",
    "model": {"provider": "anthropic", "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4-6"},
    "runtime": {"platform": "software-only", "measurement": "sha256:" + "0" * 64},
    "policy": {"bundle_hash": "sha256:" + "b" * 64, "enforcement_mode": "enforce"},
    "data_class": "confidential",
    "build_provenance": {"slsa_level": 1, "digest": "sha256:" + "e" * 64},
    "appraisal": {"status": "none", "verifier": "https://verifier.example.org"},
}

signed = sign_record(record, key)
```
See the [Quickstart guide](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/quickstart/) for key persistence, validation, and anchoring the record to a transparency log.

## Standards alignment

Hosted at the Linux Foundation as its own series, "TRACE Specification, a Series of LF Projects, LLC", under [LF Projects policies](https://lfprojects.org/policies/). The Linux Foundation [announced the contribution](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-welcomes-trace-to-advance-verifiable-runtime-evidence-for-ai-workloads) on 25 August 2026, developed with AMD, Intel, Microsoft, OPAQUE and TII. Builds on [RFC 9711 (EAT)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9711), [RFC 9334 (RATS)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9334), and SCITT draft-22.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is TRACE?

TRACE (Trust, Runtime Attestation, and Compliance Evidence) is an open specification for hardware-attested AI agent governance records. It defines the record format, the anchoring protocol, and the verification rules for cryptographic evidence that an AI agent ran under a specific policy, in a verified hardware environment, on a given data class, invoking identified tools.

### What does a TRACE Trust Record prove?

A single signed Trust Record answers, in a form any third party can verify without trusting the operator: what model ran, where it ran, under which policy, what data class it touched, which tools were called, and whether the record is independently anchored to a SCITT transparency ledger.

### What standards is TRACE built on?

TRACE builds on open IETF and IRTF standards: RFC 9711 (CBOR Web Token / EAT) for the claim envelope, RFC 9334 (RATS) for the attester, verifier, and relying-party roles, and the SCITT draft for transparency-ledger anchoring. It is designed for CoSAI WS4 interoperability.

### How do I create and verify a Trust Record?

Install the library with `pip install agentrust-trace`, sign a record with `sign_record(record, key)`, and check one with `verify_record(record, public_key_or_jwk=trusted_key)`, both imported from `agentrust_trace`. `verify_record` checks the profile URI, the schema, the signature over the RFC 8785 canonical form, and freshness; it checks revocation only when you pass it a revocation source, and it performs no attestation verification. The library does not anchor a record to a transparency ledger: `transparency` is a string member holding the SCITT receipt URI, which a producer fills in once its ledger returns one. The Quickstart page carries a runnable version of both steps.

### How does TRACE relate to AGT and cMCP?

TRACE is the evidence format. AGT and cMCP produce and consume Trust Records, so you can connect them into an end-to-end agent governance pipeline. See the integration guides for details.

### What is the current status of TRACE?

The current specification is TRACE v0.2, published with a conformance test suite. See the Limitations page for scope boundaries before relying on it in production.
