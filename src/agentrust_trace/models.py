    it did not itself measure, and it names what.

    This exists because ``runtime.platform: "software-only"`` alone is ambiguous.

    block existed, a record that needed to name something external had to use
    ``origin`` and take ``runtime.platform: "software-only"`` with it, which said
    something untrue about how the evidence was obtained.

    An entry is a pointer, not evidence. What the signature attests is that this
    record points there, not the truth of what it points at. The pointer is
    produced inside the boundary that produced the record; the target is not.
    Two consequences the spec states as MUST NOT are verifier behaviour and so
    are not expressible here: a verifier does not reject a record because an
    entry cannot be resolved, and it does not treat a resolved entry as attested
    evidence. Both live in the conformance suite. This model fixes the shape.

    ``rel`` is open, unlike ``Origin.kind``. Section 3.1.1 says of ``kind`` that it
    is closed "because the value of the field is that a verifier can key on it";
    section 3.1.2 deliberately does not say that of ``rel``, and calls its values a
    registry. Closing it here would make every new relation a schema change and a
    spec change at once. The registered values are named in the schema description
    and in docs/schema.md, and are documented rather than enforced.

    ``resolver`` names the party obliged to resolve ``id``. The specification
    requires a producer that cannot name one to omit the entry rather than emit a
    self-asserted resolver, and whether an identifier is self-asserted is not
    decidable from the record, so the constraint here is presence and not value.

    ``retention`` states an undertaking that nothing in the specification
