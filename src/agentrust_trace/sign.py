    malformed input, unsupported JWK type, stale record, nonce mismatch, or revoked
    key). Returns a :class:`VerificationStatement` on success. All checks fail closed.

    Profile (fail closed):
        ``accepted_profiles`` is the set of ``eat_profile`` URIs this verifier claims
        to implement; it defaults to TRACE v0.2 alone. A record carrying any other
        profile is refused rather than verified on a best-effort basis, because
        "the signature checks out" says nothing about whether this code implements
        the semantics the record was written under. `spec/trace-v0.2.md` requires
        exactly this of a v0.2 verifier, and forbids accepting the v0.1 identifier
        alongside it — passing a set containing ``TRACE_PROFILE_V0_1`` raises
        ``ValueError`` before any record is examined, so the dual-accepting verifier
        the cutover forbids cannot be configured here at all. Declared downgrade to
        other, legitimately owned older profiles remains representable.

        The profile is read before the signature is checked, so the refusal is cheap;
        a record that returns successfully has had its profile covered by the verified
        signature, since the signature spans the whole record.

    Trust anchoring (fail closed):
        Without a trusted key, the record cannot vouch for itself, so verification
        is refused. Set ``allow_embedded_key=True`` to opt in to verifying against
        ``record["cnf"]["jwk"]`` — this only proves internal consistency, not
        authenticity, and emits a loud ``UserWarning``.

    Freshness (fail closed):
        ``max_age_seconds`` (default 86400 = 24h) bounds how old ``record["iat"]``
        may be relative to now; pass ``None`` to disable the age check. If
        ``expected_nonce`` is given, it is compared in constant time against
        ``record["runtime"]["nonce"]``. A stale record or nonce mismatch raises
        ``ValueError``.

    Revocation (fail closed):
        ``spec/trace-v0.2.md`` §3.2.1 requires a verifier to consult current
        revocation status at verification time. Pass a ``revocation`` store, either
        a container of revoked key identifiers or a callable performing a live
        CRL/status/SCITT lookup. The trusted key is rejected if it is listed, or if
        the store cannot answer. Identifiers are the key's RFC 7638 thumbprint
        (``jwk_thumbprint``) and its ``kid``.

        ``revocation=None`` (the default) skips the check and keeps verification
        purely offline. Offline verification cannot prove non-revocation: a
        signature made by a compromised key stays cryptographically valid forever,
        and nothing inside the record can retract it. See ``LIMITATIONS.md``.
