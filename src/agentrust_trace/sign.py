        signature, since the signature spans the whole record.

    Trust anchoring (fail closed):
        Without a trusted key, the record cannot vouch for itself, so verification
        is refused. Set ``allow_embedded_key=True`` to opt in to verifying against
        ``record["cnf"]["jwk"]``: this only proves internal consistency, not
        authenticity, and emits a loud ``UserWarning``.

    Freshness (fail closed):
        ``max_age_seconds`` (default 86400 = 24h) bounds how old ``record["iat"]``
        may be relative to now; pass ``None`` to disable the age check.
        ``max_future_skew_seconds`` (default 300 = 5m) bounds tolerated clock skew;
        a record dated further in the future is rejected. If
        ``expected_nonce`` is given, it is compared in constant time against
        ``record["runtime"]["nonce"]``. A stale record or nonce mismatch raises
        ``ValueError``. ``now`` pins the verification moment (Unix epoch seconds)
        for both the record-age check and the bundle-age check below; it defaults
        to the clock, and a conformance vector supplies it so the outcome
        reproduces from retained facts rather than from when the test ran.

    Revocation (reported, never implied):
        ``spec/trace-v0.2.md`` section 3.2.3 separates three states and forbids
        reporting any of them as an affirming appraisal: verified against a
        revocation bundle valid at T; unverified for revocation, because the newest
        bundle is past the profile's maximum age; and no revocation check performed,
        because there was no bundle. The result's ``revocation`` field carries which
        one applied and the facts a second verifier needs to reach it again.

        Pass ``revocation_bundle``, a dict validated here against
        ``schema/trace-revocation-bundle.json``, together with
        ``trusted_bundle_keys``, the JWKs whose signatures the caller accepts on a
        bundle. The bundle is evidence only while both age bounds hold: the
        issuer's ``valid_until`` and the caller's ``max_bundle_age_seconds``,
        measured from ``issued_at``. The tighter bound governs. 86400 is section
        3.2.2's default maximum age, applied to bundles by 3.2.3's "same
        maximum-age model" sentence; 3.2.3 names no bundle default of its own and
        defers the value to the deployment profile. A bundle that is malformed,
        signed by a key not in ``trusted_bundle_keys``, signed with an algorithm
        this build cannot verify, dated in the future, or expired under either
        bound yields ``unverified_for_revocation`` with the cause named; it does
        not raise, because inability to check is not evidence of a defect. A
        statement on the bundle's log naming the trusted key raises ``ValueError``:
        no inclusion entry ID reaches this function, so 3.2.3's fallback applies
        and every record the key signed is rejected.

        ``revocation`` is the older store interface and still works: a container
        of revoked key identifiers or a callable performing a live lookup. The
        trusted key is rejected if it is listed, or if the store cannot answer.
        A store that answers "not listed" is a check performed; the result reports
        ``verified`` with ``source: "store"`` and no horizon, because a store has
        none. Identifiers are the key's RFC 7638 thumbprint (``jwk_thumbprint``)
        and its ``kid``, and the check reads the trusted key, never
        ``record["cnf"]["jwk"]``.

        With neither a bundle nor a store the result reports
        ``no_check_performed``. That is the honest offline default, and it is
        what the old ``None`` return withheld: verification that proves the record
        was validly signed by this key, and nothing about whether the key is still
        trusted. See ``LIMITATIONS.md``.

        The outcome is a value in the result rather than an exception or a
        separate entry point, so a caller has to handle it to know it. A caller
        who discards the return has the fail-open behaviour the old signature
        had; the alternatives were worse, and the reasoning is on issue #190.
