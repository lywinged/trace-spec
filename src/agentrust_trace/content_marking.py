"""Bind a C2PA-marked asset to the execution that produced it.

Implements ``spec/content-marking-v1.md``: one assertion, ``com.agentrust-io.trace``,
carrying a hashed reference to a Trust Record.

**This module does not touch media files.** It builds and checks the assertion
payload; embedding it in an asset and signing the C2PA manifest is c2pa tooling's
job, and pretending otherwise would put a media-format dependency inside a
signing library for no benefit.

The function that earns its place is :func:`verify_assertion`. Anyone can write
a JSON object with a URL in it; the hash over the referenced record bytes is what
makes the assertion mean something, and checking it requires the bytes. That is
also the step an implementer skips, so it is a parameter that cannot be omitted
rather than an optional extra.
