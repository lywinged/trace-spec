"""TraceSandboxAdapter: maps a sandboxed agent runtime's session output to a Trust Record.

A sandboxed agent runtime confines one agent on one machine: filesystem, process and
network isolation at the kernel, an egress policy, and credentials injected without the
agent holding them. That answers what a single agent may touch. It does not answer, on
its own, what the agent did, under which rules, on which machine, in a form somebody who
trusts neither the operator nor the vendor can check.

This adapter closes that gap without changing the runtime. It consumes what the runtime
already has at session close and emits a signed Trust Record::

    session = SandboxSessionResult(
        sandbox_id="spiffe://runtime.example.org/sandbox/build-7f2a",
        image_digest="sha256:" + "a" * 64,
        policy_bundle_bytes=Path("sandbox-policy.yaml").read_bytes(),
        decisions=runtime.decision_log(),
    )
    record = sign_record(adapter.build_trust_record(session), key)

Two things separate this from :class:`~agentrust_trace.adapters.agt.TraceAGTAdapter`,
and both come from the deployments this was written for.

**It spans Level 0 and Level 1 from one code path.** A sandbox runs wherever the
customer runs it: a laptop with a TPM, a confidential VM, a machine with no secure
hardware at all. Passing a :class:`SandboxAttestation` moves the record from
``software-only`` to the platform that produced the evidence, and nothing else about
the call changes. An adapter that could only emit Level 0 would force a second code
path for the deployments that matter most.

**It rejects the ways a caller can misname unattested evidence; it does not appraise the
evidence itself.** ``platform`` is only ever set from a supplied attestation, an
attestation may not name ``software-only``, the platform is checked against the enum on
:class:`~agentrust_trace.models.RuntimeInfo` rather than a copy of it, and
``measurement`` must be a ``sha256:``/``sha384:`` digest. That is shape validation, not
cryptographic verification: nothing here checks a quote, a signature, or a nonce, so
constructing a :class:`SandboxAttestation` with an invented platform and an invented
digest is accepted and reaches the record unchanged. This is the same boundary
docs/trust-levels.md states for every Level 1 producer --
``agentrust_trace.sign.verify_record`` does not appraise hardware quotes either -- and it
applies here for the same reason: appraising the evidence requires the platform's own
verification path (a TDX/SEV-SNP quote check against the vendor's key, a TPM quote check
against a known PCR policy, and so on), which is outside what a record-shaped library can
do generically. Pass a :class:`SandboxAttestation` only after your own attestation
verifier has checked genuine evidence from the named platform; passing one built from
data your process invented produces a Level 1-shaped record with no Level 1 assurance
behind it.

**Independently verified evidence is necessary but not sufficient.** docs/trust-levels.md
is explicit that Level 1 needs "authenticated evidence binding the record-signing key to
the expected environment," and docs/verification.md puts the responsibility for that
binding on "the producing profile." This adapter is that producing profile for a sandbox
runtime, and it defines no binding: nothing here ties ``measurement`` (or ``nonce``) to
the specific key that ends up in the record's ``cnf.jwk`` -- the key :func:`sign_record`
is called with is chosen independently of, and after, whatever attestation was verified.
A caller who verifies a genuine quote and then signs with an unrelated key produces a
record that is no more bound to hardware than a fabricated one; :class:`SandboxAttestation`
and :func:`~agentrust_trace.sign.sign_record` cannot tell the two cases apart. If your
attestation flow supports a caller-supplied challenge (a TPM quote's qualifying data, an
SNP report's ``REPORT_DATA``, a TDX quote's ``REPORTDATA``), bind it yourself: request the
quote with that field set to a value derived from the signing key you are about to pass to
``sign_record`` (for example its RFC 7638 thumbprint), verify the quote's binding to that
value in your own verifier, and only then carry it through as :attr:`SandboxAttestation.nonce`
so a downstream verifier that knows your convention can check it too.
:func:`~agentrust_trace.sign.verify_record` does not check this binding either -- nothing
in this codebase does; it is on you and on whatever verifier you point at these records.

Sandbox identity and image are carried in the existing v0.2 fields (``subject`` and
``build_provenance.digest``). A dedicated ``sandbox`` object belongs in a later profile;
this adapter deliberately needs no schema change.
