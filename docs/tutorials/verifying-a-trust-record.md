# Verify a Trust Record

Check the integrity and schema conformance of a TRACE Trust Record you received from a third party, and decide whether to trust the agent session it describes.

## What you'll learn

- What `verify_record()` does internally, step by step
- How to verify against a pinned trusted key instead of the embedded key
- How built-in schema validation rejects malformed signed records
- How to collect all validation errors with `iter_errors()`
- How to interpret `runtime.platform` to distinguish development from hardware-attested records
- What to do when verification fails

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install agentrust-trace
```

## Understand What verify_record() Does

When you call `verify_record(record, trusted_key)` the library:

1. Requires the exact TRACE v0.2 profile and validates the complete record against its canonical JSON Schema
2. Reads `record["signature"]` and base64url-decodes it to raw bytes
3. Resolves the trusted key you supplied, checking `kty == "OKP"` and `crv == "Ed25519"` before reconstructing an `Ed25519PublicKey` from the `x` field
4. Enforces freshness: rejects records whose `iat` is older than `max_age_seconds` (default 24h) or further in the future than `max_future_skew_seconds` (default 5m), and, if you pass `expected_nonce`, compares it in constant time to `runtime.nonce`
5. Rebuilds the canonical payload with all fields except `signature`, using RFC 8785 (JCS)
6. Calls `Ed25519PublicKey.verify(sig_bytes, payload_bytes)` from the `cryptography` library
7. Returns `None` on success, raises `cryptography.exceptions.InvalidSignature` on a bad signature and `ValueError` on every other rejection

A trusted key is required. A record cannot authenticate itself with the key it embeds, so `verify_record` will not fall back to `cnf.jwk` unless you explicitly opt in with `allow_embedded_key=True` (which emits a `UserWarning`, since it proves only internal consistency, not authenticity).

```python
import json
from agentrust_trace import verify_record
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidSignature

with open("session.trace.json") as f:
    record = json.load(f)

# trusted_jwk obtained out-of-band (see "Verify Against a Pinned Public Key" below)
try:
    verify_record(record, trusted_jwk)
    print("signature valid")
except InvalidSignature:
    print("signature invalid: record may have been tampered with")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"verification failed: {e}")
```

`ValueError` is raised when schema conformance fails, no trusted key is supplied, the record is missing a `signature` field, a key or signature cannot be decoded, the JWK type is not Ed25519, or the record is stale. Treat all of these as verification failure.

---

## Verify Against a Pinned Public Key

The embedded `cnf.jwk` names the key the record claims made its mandatory signature binding. It cannot establish trust by itself. Supply a trusted public key out of band; `verify_record()` requires the embedded and trusted keys to have the same RFC 7638 thumbprint, then verifies the signature with the trusted key.

Pass either an `Ed25519PublicKey` object or a JWK dict you obtained out-of-band (for example, from the issuer's published key manifest):

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ed25519 import Ed25519PublicKey
import base64

# Trusted JWK obtained from the issuer's key directory
trusted_jwk = {
    "kty": "OKP",
    "crv": "Ed25519",
    "x": "<base64url public key bytes>",
}

# verify_record accepts a JWK dict directly
verify_record(record, trusted_jwk)
```

Or with an `Ed25519PublicKey` object:

```python
x_bytes = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(trusted_jwk["x"] + "==")
pub_key = Ed25519PublicKey.from_public_bytes(x_bytes)

verify_record(record, pub_key)
```

When you supply a key, the library first requires it to identify the same public key as `cnf.jwk`, ignoring optional JWK metadata such as `kid`, and then uses the trusted key for signature verification. A key mismatch raises `ValueError`; a matching key with an invalid signature raises `InvalidSignature`.

---

## Validate the Schema

Signature verification confirms the record was not modified after signing. It says nothing about whether the record conforms to the TRACE v0.2 schema. A valid signature over a malformed record is still a malformed record.

Call `validate_json()` to check schema conformance. It raises `jsonschema.ValidationError` on the first violation:

```python
from agentrust_trace import validate_json
import jsonschema

try:
    validate_json(record)
except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
    print(f"schema violation: {e.message}")
    print(f"at path: {list(e.absolute_path)}")
```

To collect all violations at once instead of stopping at the first:

```python
from agentrust_trace import iter_errors

errors = iter_errors(record)
if errors:
    for e in errors:
        print(f"{list(e.absolute_path)}: {e.message}")
else:
    print("schema valid")
```

Run schema validation before trusting any claims in the record. A record that passes both `verify_record()` and `validate_json()` was signed by the stated key and has a well-formed structure.

---

## Check the EAT Profile

Every TRACE record carries an `eat_profile` field that identifies the spec version. Reject records with an unexpected profile before parsing their claims:

```python
EXPECTED_PROFILE = "tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2"

if record.get("eat_profile") != EXPECTED_PROFILE:
    raise ValueError(f"unexpected eat_profile: {record.get('eat_profile')!r}")
```

---

## Interpret the Appraisal Status

After verifying the signature and schema, read `appraisal.status`:

```python
status = record["appraisal"]["status"]

if status == "affirming":
    # All evidence passed appraisal. Safe to act on the session output.
    pass
elif status == "warning":
    # Evidence passed with conditions. Review before acting.
    pass
elif status == "contraindicated":
    # Evidence failed. Treat the session output as untrusted.
    raise RuntimeError("appraisal contraindicated: do not process agent output")
elif status == "none":
    # No appraisal performed (software-only Level 0 record).
    # Acceptable for development; not acceptable for production.
    pass
```

---

## Distinguish Software-Only from Hardware-Attested Records

The `runtime.platform` field tells you the attestation root. Before trusting a record in a production context, confirm it is not a development record:

```python
runtime = record["runtime"]

if runtime["platform"] == "software-only":
    # All-zero measurement, no TEE binding. Only accept in dev/test.
    raise ValueError("software-only records are not accepted in production")

# Hardware-attested platforms
HARDWARE_PLATFORMS = {
    "intel-tdx",
    "amd-sev-snp",
    "nvidia-h100",
    "nvidia-blackwell",
    "aws-nitro",
    "arm-cca",
    "google-confidential-space",
    "tpm2",
}

if runtime["platform"] not in HARDWARE_PLATFORMS:
    raise ValueError(f"unknown platform: {runtime['platform']!r}")

print(f"platform: {runtime['platform']}")
print(f"measurement: {runtime['measurement']}")
```

For hardware-attested records, `runtime.measurement` is a real digest from the TEE. To confirm the key was generated inside the attested enclave, compare `runtime.measurement` against the published Reference Integrity Manifest at `runtime.rim_uri`. See [Hardware attestation platforms](hardware-attestation-platforms.md) for per-platform details.

## Complete Verification Sequence

Put it together for a production verifier:

```python
import json
from agentrust_trace import verify_record, validate_json, iter_errors
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidSignature
import jsonschema

def verify_trust_record(path: str, trusted_jwk: dict) -> dict:
    with open(path) as f:
        record = json.load(f)

    # 1. Schema validation first: reject malformed records early
    errors = iter_errors(record)
    if errors:
        messages = [e.message for e in errors]
        raise ValueError(f"schema violations: {messages}")

    # 2. Signature verification
    try:
        verify_record(record, trusted_jwk)
    except InvalidSignature:
        raise RuntimeError("signature invalid: record tampered or wrong key")
    except ValueError as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"record malformed: {e}")

    # 3. Profile check
    if record.get("eat_profile") != "tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2":
        raise ValueError(f"unexpected eat_profile: {record.get('eat_profile')!r}")

    # 4. Appraisal
    status = record["appraisal"]["status"]
    if status == "contraindicated":
        raise RuntimeError("appraisal contraindicated: do not process agent output")

    return record
```

## What to Do When Verification Fails

If `verify_record()` raises `InvalidSignature`:

- Do not process the agent output.
- Do not rely on any claim in the record.
- Log the failure with the record's `subject` and `iat` fields for audit purposes.
- Investigate whether the record was modified in transit or the wrong key was used.

A failed signature means either the record was tampered with after issuance, or it was not signed by the key in `cnf.jwk`. Either way, the record cannot be trusted.

---

## Summary

You verified a TRACE Trust Record by checking its Ed25519 signature, validating its schema, and interpreting the appraisal status. Signature verification uses the embedded `cnf.jwk` by default; pass a trusted key to pin verification to a specific issuer. Schema validation with `validate_json()` or `iter_errors()` is a separate step that confirms the record structure is well-formed.
