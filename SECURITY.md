# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository contains the TRACE specification, machine-readable schemas, conformance fixtures, and the `agentrust-trace` Python reference library. Security issues fall into two categories:

**Specification vulnerabilities**: flaws in the TRACE spec that would allow an attacker to forge a valid Trust Record, bypass verification, break the cryptographic chain, or make verifiable claims that are structurally false. These are the most serious and are treated as critical.

**Implementation vulnerabilities**: flaws in the Python signing or verification APIs, schemas, adapters, reference examples, packaging, or release automation that could accept, produce, or distribute insecure Trust Records. Report these here.

Vulnerabilities in the reference implementation (cMCP) should be reported at [agentrust-io/cmcp](https://github.com/agentrust-io/cmcp) using its security policy.

## Reporting

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report vulnerabilities via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec/security/advisories/new). Do not use public issues.

Include:
- A description of the vulnerability and the affected spec section or schema path
- The attack scenario: what can an attacker do, what invariant is broken
- Whether you believe this affects existing Trust Records produced by conformant implementations
- Your preferred disclosure timeline

## Response SLAs

| Severity | Initial response | Fix target |
|---|---|---|
| Critical (forgeable Trust Record, broken verification chain) | 24 hours | 7 days |
| High (verification bypass, misleading schema, incorrect normative text) | 48 hours | 14 days |
| Medium / Low (editorial, non-normative) | 5 business days | Next spec patch |

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. We will work with reporters to agree on a disclosure timeline before publishing any advisory. We will credit reporters in the changelog unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| TRACE v0.2 / `agentrust-trace` 0.x | Yes |
| TRACE v0.1 and earlier drafts | No |
